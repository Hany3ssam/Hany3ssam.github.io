<p>
Part of Coursera's assignment submission is to verify your identity; they do that through 2 methods, your typing behavior and your webcam.
well, what if I don't have a webcam or my webcam is broken!, Thatâ€™s exactly what happen to me, i couldn't submit my assignment as my webcam is broken, but I do have a mobile that has 2 cameras(front and rear), is it possible to use them! 
</p>
<p>Immediately head to Google and it didn't take long until I found a solution, There is a mobile application call <em>IP Webcam</em> that allow you to use your mobile's camera as a webcam, All you need to do is download the app from the Play Store, have your mobile connected to a Wi-Fi network and Your done. </p>
<p>Now im able to verify my identity and submit my assignment on Coursera, You can also use it with Skype or whatever. </p>
Awesome!
