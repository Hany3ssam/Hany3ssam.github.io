For the past few weeks i have been doing some thinking about my career path, whether should i go for an MBA or pursue another bachelor degree in Computer Science.<br>
Luckly i found this great Computer Science curriculum <a href="https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/">OSSU</a>, 
A free online resources for a complete Computer Science major curriculum "in order".
</p>
<p>
	 So this is a great opportunity for someone whos short on cash to learn a CS degree subjects and classes online,
	 the crriculum is very up to date with today's technology and cover a lot of the Hot topics(Data Science, IoT) along with a solid foundation classes(Math and Algorithms).
</p>
<p>
	Some of the classes as the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Introduction to Computer Science</li>
		<li>Math (Mathematical Thinking)</li>
		<li>Program Design</li>
		<li>Algorithms</li>
		<li>Software Testing</li>
		<li>Operating Systems</li>
		<li>Data Bases</li>
		<li>Compilers</li>
	</ul>
	and more..
</p>
<p>
	Im really excited and i believe this list might take up to a year and a half to be finished.
