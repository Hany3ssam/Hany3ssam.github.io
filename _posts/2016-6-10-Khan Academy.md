As i progress in the computer Science curriculum <a href="https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/curriculum">OSSU</a>, I came across the course Introduction to Mathematical Thinking from Stanford on Coursera, The course advance and work on thinking ability, However this course builds on high school math(Algebra I,II and Geometry), As someone who’s graduate from high school +10 years ago i wanted to fresh up my math memory and skills.

<p>
	The first thing came to my mind is <em>Khan Academy</em>, i found Khan Academy very long time ago but never use it except for a little basic Algorithms tutorials, and to be honest I’m fascinated by the idea behind the initiative and totally support it.

	Khan Academy founded by Salman Khan, who's started by teaching his cousin early math through the internet using very humble technology like Yahoo messenger as i recall, then as his family members and their friends who wanted help with their Math skills started to grow, he started making videos on YouTube, before receiving a huge  support from the community and Bill Gates.

<p>Khan Academy is a nonprofit organization, present classes in Math, Physics, Computer Programming and more, Also offers its classes in a variety of languages and subtitles.</p>
I really want to pay respect to Khan Academy and the people behind it.
