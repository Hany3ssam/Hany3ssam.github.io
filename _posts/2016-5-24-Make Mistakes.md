	I just started the second course of the OSSU(Computer Science Curiculum), <em>Effective Thinking Through Mathematics</em>, conducted by Univeristy of Texas Austin, Great course.<br>
	The first puzzel we worked on called the Meanie Genie, pretty basic yet challenging one, Its idea simply represtented as the following:
	<ul>
	You have
		<li>9 Stones</li>
		<li>1 Stone that has a Rama Nujan(wieght slightly more than the other)</li>
		<li>2 balance Scale</li>
		<li>1 attempt of each balance Scale</li>
	</ul>
	Find the stone that has the Rama Nujan!
</p>
<p>
	well, the answer would be divid the 9 stones into 3 groups of 3, use the balance scale to test a 2 group of 3, if they turned out to be equal, then you are sure the stone you are looking for in the Third group you left out, take that remaining group of 3 and use your second and last attempt to find the Rama Nujan.
</p>
<p>
	Of course we didn't get the answer by our first attempt to solve the puzzel nor the other Students in the Class, and it turns out this was the Goal of the first unit as stated by the professor, <em>To Make Mistakes</em>, in other words, to try something, and most probably the first attempt will be wrong, however will lead you to the solution.

	And this was the take out from unit one as stated by the Prof, Don't be Affraid to Make Mistakes, and i wanted to share this with you.
