Building on the previous post, I want to say that most software developers are self-taught, and don’t have a CS degree; In fact, I have seen many topics on <i>Quora</i> about people wanting to have a career shift into software development, And with the Digital Era we live in today your timing couldn’t be better.<br>
Having mastered the skills I mentioned in the previous post will most likely grantee you an entry level software developer role, as a reminder you need to know the following;<br>
•	HTML<br>
•	CSS > Framework(Bootstrap)<br>
•	JavaScript > Framework(Angularjs)<br>
•	JQuery<br>
•	Server Side Language(C#, Java, Python etc.)<br>
•	OOP<br>
•	Database <br>
•	Source Control(Git)<br>
Those are enough to get you started, and I don’t want to complicate things for you talking about front end and back end routes, Let’s just say that a front end developer only concern with the UI – User Interface -, while the backend developer concern with the Business Logic/Data Integration and the functionality of the application. Either way you want to master both.<br>
The very next thing you want to do is to gain a real life experience, so learn by doing, start building applications, get a portfolio, the benefit of that is you are going to get your hands dirty and will learn more by doing, hence showcase your future employer that you have built stuff, you’re initiative and have a hands on experience, Another way to achieve that goal is to contribute to an open source projects.<br>
3 years ago, i rejected offers because the salary wasn’t enough, given that I will have to relocate and it barley will cover my expenses of rent, bills and other stuff.<br>
You don’t  want to do that, if I can give my younger self an advise I would say accept the fucking offer, get your hands dirty, you need a fucking real life experience.<br>
So with that being said, get a mentor, I wish I had a mentor to guide me, but I learned the hard way, 3 years later now and im willing to accept unpaid internship to learn and advance my skills. <br>
There is nothing to be ashamed off accepting internship at a late age, as a big fan of Friends show, I remember when Chandler quit his job and got an internship in advertising as a junior copy writer at the age of +30 while he was married to Monica. <br>So there is nothing wrong with having a career shift and starting from scratch, if anything, this shows that you are initiative, self-motivated, out of your comfort zone person, and that should appeal you employers and head hunters.<br>
Good Luck.
