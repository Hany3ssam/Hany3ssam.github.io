	<li>Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS</li>
	<li>Multiplatform Mobile App Development with Web Technologies</li>

</p>
<p>
 	<strong>About This Specialization</strong><br>
Learn front-end and mobile hybrid development, build back-end support, and implement a fully functional application.
The first two courses in this Specialization include an orientation to client-side development, covering HTML/CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, and frameworks such as AngularJS and Bootstrap. On the server side, you’ll learn to implement NoSQL databases using MongoDB, work within a Node.js environment, and communicate to the client side through a RESTful API. You’ll also learn to create hybrid mobile applications, using the Ionic framework and Cordova. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to build a fully functional web and hybrid mobile application with back-end support.

	Sounds Interesting huh!, But there is no way i can afford the course's cost while im unemployed, Luckly i applied for a Financial Aid, and Coursera offered me the Specialization free of charge.<br> <em>I got excited and finished the 1 week material and assignment in one sitting :)</em>,
	If you can't afford the cost of the course which is 395$ total(79$) each, You too can apply for a Financial Aid and most likely you will get one if you’re from a developing country like i am(Egypt).

	Coursera Also offers a Data Science and Algorithms and Data Structure Specializations , Both are very sufficient and a must have specially the Data Science as its the very high demand profssion in 2016 according to a linkedin survey.

Good Luck.
