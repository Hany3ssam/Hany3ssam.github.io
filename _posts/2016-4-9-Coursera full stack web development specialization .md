Couple days ago i head to Coursera to check their upcoming courses, i came across the Full Stack Web Development Course Specialization, Where you are going to learn and be exposed to a lot of technologies, the Specialization consist of 5 courses and a Capstone Project at the end of the course, The Courses involved as the following:<br>
<ol>
	<li>HTML, CSS and Javascript</li>
	<li>Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools</li>
	<li>Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS</li>
	<li>Multiplatform Mobile App Development with Web Technologies</li>
	<li>Server-side Development with NodeJS</li>
	<li>Full Stack Web Development Specialization Capstone Project</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
	Sounds Interesting huh!, But there is no way i can afford the course's cost while im unemployed, Luckly i applied for a Financial Aid, and Coursera offered me the Specialization free of charge.<br> <em>I got excited and finished the 1 week material and assignment in one sitting :)</em>,
	If you can't afford the cost of the course which is 395$ total(79$) each, You too can apply for a Financial Aid and most likely you will get one if youâ€™re from a developing country like i am(Egypt).

	Coursera Also offers a Data Science and Algorithms and Data Structure Specializations , Both are very sufficient and a must have specially the Data Science as its the most high demand profssion in 2016 according to a linkedin survey.

Good Luck.
