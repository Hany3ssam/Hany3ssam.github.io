Those posts dedicated for my self-paced/Online <a href="https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/curriculum">Computer Science</a> learning progress, inspired by the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT challenge</a>, i too going to learn what a CS student will probably learn in a typical university,"online for free", in case you don't know the MIT challenge, itâ€™s when a guy finished Massachusetts Institute of Technology CS curriculum using YouTube and Free resource in 1 years.

<p>So far, im at the second course Introduction to Mathematical Thinking by Stanford on Coursera, However the course's prerequisites is high school math(Algebra I,II and Geometry), and as someone who graduated high school +10 years ago, I decided to take a step back and fresh up my math skills on Khan Academy.
