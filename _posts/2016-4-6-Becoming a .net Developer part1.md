I first started my coding journey back in 2012 after i granted the Ministry of Communication and information Technology (MCIT) scholarship to study the .Net Framework for 9 months, I’m very grateful having granted this opportunity to be exposed to the software development industry, As I was working in sales in a Multinational i wasn’t fully dedicated to the course so i decided to resign and start a new career from scratch as a software developer. despite that we had intense +1200 hours of learning and studying we lack the real life experience, so the very reasonable thing to do after the course is to gain a real life experience by getting an entry level position in software house, sounds about right but it wasn’t the case for me as i live far outside the capital and there was completely zero opportunity in my home town, nor was able to relocate at that time. So i tried to break into the freelance world by setting up a couple of accounts on Upwork(Odesk back then), Elance, Khamsat(The Arabic version of Freelancer). But it was kinda hard to land a project with the fierce competition especially with Indians who willing to accept project at a very low rate, but i had worked on a couple of websites for client from KSA and Lebanon. On the side i constantly was trying to advance my skill set with enrolling for a couple of “MOOC” Online classes such as CS101 Building a search engine using python, and Web applications from Udacity, and read a couple of Head First Series from O’really, Head First C# for example, which i highly recommend. 
The one mistake i had made and you have to avoid is that, i started to learn the hell i think it’s going to land me a job, so every time i saw a job post require a specific set of skills I immediately jump and learn it thinking it is the current trend right now and hoping that i might get a job soon, so learned php, python, my sql, wordpress, android and more.. instead of focusing on one technology and becoming good at it i kept going from one tech to another thinking that way im getting better while in fact i didn’t. If you anything like me i highly advise you to stick to one programming language, and master it. for me the answer was the .Net framework/C# ; Not only it’s easy to learn and use with the cool IDE and intellisene, there is a huge support and community behind it, it’s a very powerful yet easy to learn and i highly recommend it for newbie, im not an expert to list every single advantage why you should go with Microsoft but to name a few: <br>
•	easy to learn yet very powerful and you can build the hell you want, desktop, web, mobile Using Xamarin to build Android and IOS apps using C# (which recently became free), Game Development using Unity.<br>
•	Microsoft announced that the latest ASP.NET version is now open source and you can develop/host .net applications on Linux or any platform.<br>
•	Huge community support.<br>
•	Object Oriented<br>
as i said im not the expert to name every feature why you want to go with Microsoft. Anyway whether you will go with the .Net, Java, Python or Ruby... just remember to stick to one technology and master it. A few skills that you need along your server side language:<br>
•	HTML<br>
•	CSS and Css framework(Bootstrap)<br>
•	Javascript and JS framework(Angularjs)<br>
•	JQuery<br>
•	version Control like (Github)<br>
And hopefully will land an entry level/junior role as a software developer, Later on as you grow as a software developer and you want to join the kick ass companies Facebook, Google, Microsoft etc, you definitely need to learn and understand Algorithms and Data Structures. Also a must have skill for a good software developer is problem solving, that’s what you need to work on if you want to grow as a developer, There is a book that i recommend <i>“Think Like A programmer - an introduction to creative problem solving” </i>by V.Anton Spraul, Also a book that i recommend for Algorithms and Data Structure is <i>“The Algorithms Design Manual” </i>by Steven S.Skiena, A few publishers that i recommend, <i>Apress, Itworx, O’really.<br></i>
And if you are watching video type of guy there is <i>Pluralsight, Tuts+ and Treehouse.<br></i>
Software Development is a very challenging career path and you will have a lot of fun pursuing it, and it’s worth every bit of hard work and time you put in, professionally and personal wise.<br>
P.S im not a native English Speaker so im sorry for any Typo/grammar mistakes.<br>
Until Next Time..<br>
