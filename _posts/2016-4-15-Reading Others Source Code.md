One thing that the Full Stack Web Development specialization on Coursera particularly do right, Is that, each week after you submit your assignments you have to review at least 5 students assignments and source code, And answer a few questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing this learner did particularly well in their HTML file was..</li>
<li>One way this page could be improved would be...</li>
<li>If there is any additional feedback you would like to give?</li>
</ul>
<p>
I constantly come across the concept of reading other's source code as a way of learning and becoming a better developer, And the people behind the course seems to understand that concept and support it.<br>
Honestly, i learned a lot reading other student's code, every one of them solve the problem in his unique way, and it allows you to explore more techniques.

We are just in our first course <em>Learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript</em>, And im really excited to start the next one.

I really recommend this Course and want to thank <i>“David Rossiter”</i> for his outstanding work in the First Course so far.<br>
Coursera Rock!
