### General custimizations
Added Disqus comments using (Joshua Lande's guide)[http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/] <br />
Added Google analytics using (Joshua Lande's guide)[http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/]

* Both of the above has a slight tweak with _config.yml to make future use of this script easier

Changed default favicon

Added tags (some potential for categories in post headers, but not used right now)

### CSS and head.html modifcations
Added the font-awesome css in head.html and then used it to 
create icons to my social media presence <br />
[Help with font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/)

### Sidebar modifications
Added my gravatar to the sidebar <br />
Added social links with _config.yml settings I set-up and font-awesome icons

### Remaining issues

* Must complete the about page with my own info

### Final Push

* Add SEO streamlining from [here](http://jethrokuan.github.io/2013/12/20/SEO-with-Jekyll.html)
* Add CNAME from [here](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-a-cname-record-with-your-dns-provider)

### Things to explore

* Medium and their website - [https://medium.com]
* Pandoc
* HTML and CSS
* Bootstrap - from Mark Otto

### Ideas

* Code a bar below current header with most popular tags (count beside) and serve as link to view all posts with that tag
