These posts is for my self-paced/Online <a href="https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/curriculum">Computer Science</a> learning progress, inspired by the <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT challenge</a>, i too going to learn what a CS student will probably learn in a typical university "online for free", in case you don't know the MIT challenge, it’s when a guy finished Massachusetts Institute of Technology CS curriculum using YouTube and Free resource in 2 years.
</p>
<p>So far, im in the second course Introduction to Mathematical Thinking by Stanford on Coursera, The first one was Introduction to Computer Science, And i want to point out something, im not completely sticking with the course suggested, i happen to choose a different but the same subject one for the first two courses, and here is why:<br>
The First course was CS50 from Harvard on edx, at first i tried the course but i didn't like it, the problem is that<br>
<p>Its not designed to the internet people unlike a typical online class, so we are not the target audience of the course, the instructor very super extraordinary hyper and speaks of the top of his lungs all over the time, Its make you uncomfortable and seem he is doing too much effort, you can literally see his neck veins and he's constantly sweating, and i feel they care about the Media and how the course looks like instead of the learning itself, i remember when the course came out for the first time and generated a lot of buzz, and when i tried it now, i can really see they care so much about the media and how the course will be presented<em>”im in sales, i can tell when something is fake or has another intentions"</em>, no wonder, its Harvard, of course they want to look big and nice specially they are one of the late ones who joined the MOOC and there were well established CS101 courses out there on Udacity and Coursera, so there was a bit of competition, Anyway, i decided to go with CS101 on Udacity, i took that course on 2012, and quickly went through it again, to be honest i liked this course over CS50.
</p>
The second course is Mathematical Thinking on edx as well, Also tried it for a week but didn't like it too, it’s a little bit shallow and also its target audience seems to be not completely the user behind the screen, so there were distraction and you kind of feel left out, Fortunately I found Introduction to Mathematical Thinking from Stanford on Coursera, However the course's prerequisites is high school math(Algebra I,II and Geometry) and as someone who graduated high school  +10 years ago, I decided to take a step back and fresh up my math skills on Khan Academy.
