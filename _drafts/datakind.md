<h2>The Hippocratic Oath for Data Science</h2>
<p>Tim Rich closed the discussion beautifully with a call to action for us all: “My big beef with discussions on ethics is it ends at the door.  Because we are all engaged in data science as our trade, writing down ethical statements is what needs to happen next.  We can talk all day long but we need to start codifying and we need to work together by writing it down.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While we almost certainly ended the evening with more questions than before, everyone at least left with more insight into the ethical challenges at play in our work.  For further reading, Jake recommends the book, <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Raw_Data_Is_an_Oxymoron.html?id=oARaHF4D6h0C">Raw Data is an Oxymoron</a>, and we also love the <a href="https://responsibledata.io/">Responsible Data Forum series</a>, <a href="http://www.datasociety.net/">Data &amp; Society</a> as well as <a href="http://dssg.io/blog/" target="_blank">Data Science for Social Good fellows blog series</a> for more stories from the forefront of data-for-good!</p>
