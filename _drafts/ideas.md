## New 2014 organization of ideas
* I should write about the summer research projects I did as an undergraduate
* Write about PRAISE volunteering 
* Write about PRAISE research projects and publications - "conducting research on the side"
* Write about myGov app idea
* EMR/EHR - open standard exists? or make one? Need them compatible across systems
* EMR/EHR - open source system? Where pt can get their own data, standardizes/compatible implementation across clinics, research wing to pull anonymized data, referral system and appointment booking system
* visiting the doctor - # people who visit and leave with a Rx or Dx, Expectations in a doc appointment, # leave wtih Dx or Rx does it vary across specialties
* Storing and sharing of data in science/neuroimaging
* copyright, trademark and patents -> uses, differences, definitions

## Original About text

<p class="message">
  Hey there! This page is included as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!
</p>

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mdo).

Thanks for reading!

title: Example content
---

<div class="message">
  Howdy! This is an example blog post that shows several types of HTML content supported in this theme.
</div>

Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis <a href="#">dis parturient montes</a>, nascetur ridiculus mus. *Aenean eu leo quam.* Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.

> Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

Etiam porta **sem malesuada magna** mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.

## Inline HTML elements

HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

- **To bold text**, use `<strong>`.
- *To italicize text*, use `<em>`.
- Abbreviations, like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langage">HTML</abbr> should use `<abbr>`, with an optional `title` attribute for the full phrase.
- Citations, like <cite>&mdash; Mark otto</cite>, should use `<cite>`.
- <del>Deleted</del> text should use `<del>` and <ins>inserted</ins> text should use `<ins>`.
- Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses `<sup>` and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses `<sub>`.

Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.

## Heading

Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue rutrum faucibus dolor auctor. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.

### Code

Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis `code element` montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

{% highlight js %}
// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console

// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
// > 8
{% endhighlight %}

Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod. Fusce dapibus, tellus ac cursus commodo, tortor mauris condimentum nibh, ut fermentum massa.

### NOTES

Include my google scholars account - http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Xrn76pEAAAAJ&hl=en

Patrick Steadman is a M.Sc. student at the University of Toronto in medical biophysics. He joined MICe first in the summer of 2010 as a research student with Dr. Jason Lerch. During this time, he worked on developing a time course of neuroanatomical changes in the adult mouse brain associated with learning. Starting in August 2011 as a graduate student with Dr. Lerch, his research will focus on the development of an image analysis pipeline to quantify anatomical features in the mouse cerebellum. This pipeline, along with mouse genetic models, will hopefully provide insight into neurodevelopmental diseases, such as ADHD and Autism. Patrick holds a B.Sc. Honours in medical and health physics from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. During his time at McMaster, Patrick completed research projects at Health Canada in Ottawa and the McMaster Nuclear Reactor in Hamilton. -- from mouseimaging.ca


/Notes
Living archive of your active and past research, key thinkers and theories you are working with, your interpretations and reflections captured over time - fantastic resource for papers and publications
A place for public engagement, discussion, developing ideas with yourself and others
Shop window to your work and expertise
/Task 1
Who are your audience(s)?
Canadians, people interested in neuroscience, neuroimaging and science policy, people interested in autism, people interested in medicine
Who are you writing for? 
Canadians/people who want to learn about neuroimaging, autism, the brain.
What skills or qualities will my audience need for my blog to be relevant and interesting to them?
Read to read, understand english and want to learn neuroscience/physics
/Task 1 continued
What will I blog about?

What makes a good academic blog post?
readable and accessible writing, personal or insightful take on the topic, relevant and timely content,  a sense of openness to discussion or comment (encouraging readers to engage), Adding value to the writing [include visuals, links, and alert readers to new key event or publication]
What should you blog about?
Accessible discussion of research and the process of research as it progresses; quirky or playful content that is related to and/or helps you draw out and engage others in your work; reviews, discussions, commentaries of literature or ideas you are examining [neuroskeptic does this a lot]; interesting questions or material that has raised good debate in teaching and presentations; reflective takes on your own or others' work; some sense of you as a person, bring your own perspective and interest into your posts, make it personal (but appropriate)
Showing how research works, how interconnected it is with what other people are doing can help bring down some of the myths about The Ivory Tower - the process of doing research
Post regularly and relevantly! 
Dont share confidential information, things which may impact my reputation or credibility, spam, anything you would not want a peer, colleague or media to see or read
Always credit authors, images, quotes, theories, ideas etc.; respond to comments; link to useful sites; provide usable references; never quote whole documents or images that you do not have the rights to share

/Task 2: planning content
Translation science or science translation - posts about taking science from researchers and digesting it for all Canadians --> specifically neuroscience, biomedical sciences
Making sense of grad school, finding my niche in academia, doing good science, science journalism, communicating science, funding science, neuroimaging

Sharable posts rock! - numbered lists are good, at least 1 image per post, include a call to action - a request to follow up, share YOUR posts!

/Task 3: Prepare a post
Consider:
Topic you want to discuss
What you want to say, what your perspective is
The people who will be reading the post and what they will understand - do you need to explain any particular phrases?
How you will include or reference literature, artefacts, other posts?
How you would break the post into readable sections, use images etc.
